# COMP30023 Computer Systems 

# Project 2 DNS Server

## Phases
This project should be executed in two phases: one starting now and one in a week’s time. This document describes both phases; there is only one deliverable

Phase 1 of this project is to design and write as much code as possible without using sockets. This involves looking up the reference and other resources to understand the format of DNS messages, formatting of log entries (with timestamps), and thinking about how to achieve caching and non-blocking if those options are chosen. Example DNS requests and replies are avilable at comp30023-2021-projects/project-2 on Gitlab. It is strongly recommended that you get Phase 1 working by the end of Week 9.

Phase 2 is to write the socket code, and integrate it with the code written in Phase 1.

## Why is it structured as two phases?
All the material for Phase 1 has already been covered in lectures. Hence, you can immediately start work on this phase. However, Phase 2 uses socket programming, which will not be covered until week 9.

The project is big enough that it is important to start it now, instead of leaving it until week 9.
 
If all this is confusing, you can treat the project as a single project, and accept the fact that sockets will not be covered in lectures for a while.

## 1 Background
Note: This project will contain some reading of standards as well as writing code. If you ever write an implementation of a protocol, you will need to read standards such as these. Therefore, becoming familiar with the format and terminology is an important part of the field of computer systems. You will be pointed to the relevant sections so that you do not spend your whole time reading the more arcane
parts of the text.

The Domain Name System (DNS) provides, among other things, the mapping between human-meaningful hostnames like lms.unimelb.edu.au and the numeric IP addresses that indicate where packets should be sent. DNS consists of a hierarchy of servers, each knowing a portion of the complete mapping.

In this project, you will write a DNS server that accepts requests for IPv6 addresses and serves them either from its own cache or by querying servers higher up the hierarchy. Each transaction consists of at most four messages: one from your client to you, one from you to your upstream server, one from your upstream server to you and one from you to your client. The middle two can be sometimes skipped if
you cache some of the answers.

The format for DNS request and response messages are described in [1].

In a DNS system, the entry mapping a name to an IPv6 address is called a AAAA (or “quad A”) record [2]. Its “record type” is 28 (QType in [2]).

The server will also keep a log of its activities. This is important for reasons such as detecting denial-ofservice attacks, as well as allowing service upgrades to reflect usage patterns.

For the log, you will need to print a text version of the IPv6 addresses. IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long. They are represented in text as eight colon-separated strings of 16-bit numbers expressed in hexadecimal. As a shorthand, a string of consecutive 16-bit numbers that are all zero may be replaced by a single “::”. Details are in [3].

## 2 Project specification
Task: Write a miniature DNS server that will serve AAAA queries.

This project has three variants, with increasing levels of difficulty. It is not expected that most students will complete all tasks; the hard ones are to challenge those few who want to be challenged.

It is expected that about half the class will complete the Standard option (and do it well – you can get an H1 by getting full marks on this), a third to complete the Cache option, and a sixth to complete the Non-blocking option. If you think the project is taking too much time, make sure you are doing the Standard option.

You should create a Makefile that produces an executable named ’dns_svr’.

Submission will be through git and LMS, like the first project.

### 2.1 Standard option
Accept a DNS “AAAA” query over TCP on port 8053. Forward it to a server whose IPv4 address is the first command-line argument and whose port is the second command-line argument. (For testing, use the value in /etc/resolv.conf on your server and port 53). Send the response back to the client who sent the request, over the same TCP connection. There will be a separate TCP connection for each query/response with the client. Log these events, as described below.

Note that DNS usually uses UDP, but this project will use TCP because it is a more useful skill for you to learn. A DNS message over TCP is slightly different from that over UDP: it has a two-byte header that specify the length (in bytes) of the message, not including the two-byte header itself [4, 5]. This means that you know the size of the message before you read it, and can malloc() enough space for it.

Assume that there is only one question in the DNS request you receive, although the standard allows there to be more than one. If there is more than one answer in the reply, then only log the first one, but always reply to the client with the entire list of answers. If there is no answer in the reply, log the request line only. If the first answer in the response is not a AAAA field, then do not print a log entry
(for any answer in the response).

The program should be ready to accept another query as soon as it has processed the previous query and response. (If Non-blocking option is implemented, it must be ready before this too.)

Your server should not shut down by itself. SIGINT (like CTRL-C) will be used to terminate your server between test cases. You may notice that a port and interface which has been bound to a socket sometimes cannot be reused until after a timeout. To make your testing and our marking easier, please override this behaviour by placing the following lines before the bind() call:

int enable = 1;
if (setsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &enable, sizeof(int)) < 0) {
  perror("setsockopt");
  exit(1);
}

### 2.2 Cache option
As above, but cache the five (5) most recent answers to queries. Answer directly if possible, instead of querying the server again.

Note that the ID field of the reply must be changed for each query so that the client doesn’t report an error. The time-to-live (TTL) field of the reply must also be decremented by the amount of time which has passed.

Note also that cache entries can expire. A cache entry should not be used once it has expired and a new query should be sent to the recursive server.

If a new answer is received when the cache contains an expired entry, the expired entry (or another expired entry) should be overwritten. If there is no expired entry, any cache eviction policy is allowed.

Do not cache responses that do not contain answers (i.e., the address was not found). If multiple answers are returned, only cache the first one.

If you implementing caching, include the line “#define CACHE” in your code. Otherwise, this functionality will not be tested/marked.

### 2.3 Non-blocking option
It can sometimes take a while for the server that was queried to give a response. To perform a recursive DNS lookup, many servers may need to be contacted (when starting from an empty cache, from a root DNS server down to an authoritative DNS server); any of them may be congested. Meanwhile, another request may have arrived, which the server cannot respond to if it was blocked by the completion of the
first request.

This option extends both options above and mitigates this problem, by enabling the processing of new requests while waiting for prior requests to complete.

This may be done using multi-threading, or select(3)/epoll(7). Using multithreading may require explicit locking of shared resources, such as the cache, whereas a single threaded implementation using select() will not require that. However, using select() may require significant refactoring if it is not considered in the initial code design.

If you choose this option, you are expected to read further about multi-threading and/or select() on your own (extending from week 3 and 10 practicals). This is training for what computer professionals are expected to do.

Please use only a single process; do not use fork() or other means to create additional processes. 

Remember that this is an advanced option; you are able to get 90% without doing it. Your time is probably better spent ensuring you did well on the other parts. However, if you are realistically aiming for 15/15, then this option is for you.

If you implement non-blocking, include the line “#define NONBLOCKING” in your code. Otherwise, this functionality will not be tested/marked.
